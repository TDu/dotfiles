#dotFiles

Keeping safe and easily transferable the dotfiles I care about.

To avoid creating a git repo in my home directory, which has been noted by others to be bad practice (security, ease of use, ?) they are stored in a separate folder.

And I am using gnu-stow (apt-get install stow) to manage the symlink.
